# cpp_statemachine_generator

## Introduction

This is a C++ statemachine generator that generates statemachines based on <https://github.com/dziegel/cpp_event_framework>
from an XMI model (e.g. created via Eclipse Papyrus <https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/>) or an SCXML mode (e.g. created with QtCreator).
The Eclipse Epsilon framework is used to implement the generator.
